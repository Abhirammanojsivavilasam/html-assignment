        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Abhiram Manoj Sivavilasam. I come from India</p>
        <p>I love working in a creative field so I ended up choosing media field. Searching for a media course and best college in Ontario province I meet some students in Algonquin and  came  to know more about College and this course. When I came to know more about Algonquin community I  decided to study here. Most exciting part is Interactive  Media  Design is best  for a student like me  who  donâ€™t  have any pervious experience in this media field. </p>
        <p>I love doing creative works and solve problems, and I believe have a good grasping capacity.Same time as a student I not good at by hearting things. In my leisure times I like to do photography, watch movies, editing etc.I strongly believe DREAM are the main factors that leads us to success and happiness.  </p>
